    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I would say yes, lab 1 taught me how to play around in javascript, especially with creating functions and basic syntax. Lab 2 taught me how event listeners work which came in handy for the like and delete button. I didn't have the time to get to lab 3 but I said those two labs served as a good base for introducing me to what I was doing. For my project I felt a bit unprepared with the rest of my javascript such as connecting it to my html, I wish we had more guidance on that. I had to use external sources such as chatgpt and gemini to guide and teach me. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would take the time to sit down and really understand my code and read it. While I do believe that I learned a lot especially with working in JSON and how it's a data file and javascript and using it to connect the JSON to html, I still feel like there were moments where I just had to search it up and hoped it work in order to complete the assignment. I

I would have added some additonal features such as a live background, I saw my peers use it and I think it's something I would have liked. Also, I'm still learning google fonts so I would have liked to add some more of those to give the screen some variety. An additional feature that I would add is probably some of the stretch features such as adding and editing a playlist. I think that would have beeen playing with the database and javascript and I would really like to see how that works. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What I think went well is my understanding of using JSON, once I was shown the demo I had a very easy time completing the JSON file on my own. I didn't need assistance from instructors or external resources which made me happy and proud of my capabilities. I also think that I feel pretty comfortable connecting html to javascript now since I had a really easy time adding the delete button from the event listener to just having the icon appear from javascript. Something that I noticed that my peers did that I would like to try is reading in full before attempting the assignment. I normally read the requirements and then read through the milestones one by one but if I had read in full then I would have learned that I didn't need to do a lot of hard coding.
